def convert_Note_to_Frequency():
    """
    Convert musical note to its frequency

    Prompts the user to enter a musical note name, and calculates
    the frequency of that note based on a predefined dictionary
    of note frequencies.

    The frequency dictionary is based on the frequencies of notes
    in the 4th octave.

    Returns:
        Prints the frequency of the note in Hz if found,
        otherwise prints an error message.
